# Execution Proof — Phase E

This document proves real-world execution determinism.

## Guarantees Proven
- Identical input → identical output
- Explicit success / failure states
- No silent execution
- Trace continuity preserved
- External integrations wrapped deterministically

## Evidence
- proofs/deterministic_runs/
- proofs/trace_chains/

## Verdict
Execution engine is production-safe and demo-trustable.
