**BHIV Core × Enforcement × Workflow Executor × Bucket**

## Declaration of Sovereign Readiness

This document formally declares the readiness of the BHIV execution stack
for internal and public demonstration under scrutiny.

It applies to:
- BHIV Core
- Enforcement Engine
- Workflow Executor
- Bucket (Truth Custody Layer)

This declaration is factual, architectural, and binding.

## What BHIV Guarantees

1. **Separation of Authority**
   - Decision-making, enforcement, execution, and truth custody are isolated
   - No layer can absorb the power of another

2. **Deterministic Enforcement**
   - Identical inputs and trace_id always yield identical outcomes
   - No discretionary execution exists

3. **Fail-Closed Safety**
   - Enforcement failures block execution
   - No unsafe default paths exist

4. **Immutable Truth**
   - All execution traces are append-only
   - No record can be modified, deleted, or reconciled

5. **Trace Integrity**
   - trace_id is created upstream
   - Propagated forward only
   - Never altered or regenerated

6. **Execution Sovereignty**
   - External APIs do not influence authority
   - All execution decisions remain locally governed

---

## What BHIV Explicitly Refuses

1. **No Forced Execution**
   - Core cannot compel Enforcement
   - Enforcement cannot compel Executor
   - Executor cannot act without authorization

2. **No Mutable History**
   - No corrections
   - No backfills
   - No “fixing” the past

3. **No Hidden Feedback Loops**
   - Bucket never influences behavior
   - Enforcement never adapts based on stored truth

4. **No Narrative Ambiguity**
   - Every outcome is explicit: success, failure, or block
   - No silent behavior

---

## What BHIV Will Never Promise

- Perfect outcomes
- Zero failures
- Autonomous intelligence
- Self-correcting history
- Retrospective authority

BHIV promises **discipline**, not infallibility.

---

## Why the System Is Safe Under Pressure

- Authority is narrow and bounded
- Failures reduce power, never expand it
- Truth is preserved even when execution fails
- Replays do not amplify effect
- No component can override another

Pressure reveals boundaries — it does not break them.

---

## Why the Demo Cannot Accidentally Lie

- Demo flows are pre-defined
- Undemonstrated behaviors are explicitly excluded
- All visible actions are trace-backed
- All claims map to observable architecture

If something cannot be proven live, it is not claimed.

---

## Final Statement

> **BHIV is not a collection of components.  
> It is a sovereign execution discipline.**

This declaration confirms that the system is:
- Demo-ready
- Pressure-safe
- Architecturally sovereign
- Defensible to technical and non-technical audiences
